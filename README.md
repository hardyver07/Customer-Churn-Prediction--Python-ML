# Telecom-Churn-Prediction--Python-ML
## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using supervised machine learning. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, the model helps identify churn-prone users and supports proactive retention strategies.
## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
## 📊 Objectives
- Analyze customer data to uncover churn patterns
- Build and evaluate classification models to predict churn
- Identify key features driving customer attrition
- Provide actionable insights for telecom retention teams
## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Simulated telecom customer dataset
- Records: ~7,000 customers
- Key Features: Tenure, contract type, monthly charges, internet service, payment method, churn status
## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Exploration
- Handled missing values and standardized categorical variables
- Explored churn distribution and feature correlations
- Visualized trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib
2. Feature Engineering
- Created binary flags and interaction terms
- Normalized numerical features and encoded categoricals
3. Modeling & Evaluation
- Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Evaluated models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
## ✅ Results
- Achieved 78% precision in churn prediction
- Identified top churn drivers: contract type, tenure, and payment method
- Enabled targeted retention strategies based on model insights
